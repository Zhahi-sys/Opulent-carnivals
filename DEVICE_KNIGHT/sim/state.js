//
// MUTATION, deliberate. `stepFrame` mutates this object in place and returns
// it, rather than building a fresh state each frame. Two reasons: GML semantics
// are mutation, so a translated Step event reads the same on both sides and
// diffs by eye; and deep-cloning every entity 30 times a second buys nothing
// when the only consumer that must not write to state is render/, which is
// enforced by review rather than by the type system.
//
// The consequence to respect: never hold a reference to state across frames
// expecting a snapshot. If you need one, serialise it.
