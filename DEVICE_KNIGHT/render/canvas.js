      // stands, which already holds the copies drawn before it this frame; the
      // chain compounds every frame and never decays while new copies keep
      // arriving. Implemented that way, ROARING's second half came out heavily
      // blurred and every star grew a radial streak — each echo redraws the
      // star field one step larger, so seven overlapping copies turn each star
      // into a line pointing away from the vortex. Both were reported from
      // play as things the real fight does not do.
      //
      // Every number below is still the dump's: the count (one per 3 frames),
      // the rates (+0.015 on the roar, -0.01 on the wind-up), the faderates
      // (0.025, and 0.1 / intensity), alpha 0.5, and the anchor arithmetic.
      // What is deviated is only WHICH frame each copy reads — all of them
      // take the frame as it stood before any echo, so seven copies are seven
      // echoes rather than seven echoes of echoes.
      //
      // Not asserted as the original's behaviour: whether GameMaker's
      // `draw_surface(application_surface)` mid-frame even returns the
      // partially-drawn frame is platform-dependent, and this project has no
      // capture of the real roar to settle it against.
      //
      // THE TWO SETS still differ in WHERE they draw.
      //
      // A `draw_end` copy is taken in the Draw End event, when the
      // application surface already holds everything drawn this frame —
      // INCLUDING the earlier Draw End copies. That chain is real and the
      // roar depends on it, but it is SHORT: faderate 0.025 is a 20-frame
      // life at one new copy every 3 frames, so about seven overlap.
      //
      // The four the roar fires through `scr_script_repeat` are NOT
      // `draw_end`. They draw in the ordinary Draw event, at the object's own
      // depth, from a partially built frame — and they are long-lived
      // (faderate 0.00625 is EIGHTY frames). Folding them into the Draw End
      // chain put four 80-frame copies inside a loop that re-copies itself
      // every frame, so the compounding never decayed. Reported as too much
      // blur in the second half of ROARING, and as the stars trailing
      // flashing lines — those are the beams of `event_user(1)`, real and
      // additive, smeared eleven deep by echoes that should not have seen
      // each other.
      //
      // They are drawn FIRST here, all from ONE snapshot of the frame as it
      // stood before any echo — which is the property that matters (no
      // chaining, and they sit under the Draw End copies). Their exact depth
      // is on the object definition, which is CLAUDE.md's `depth` hole and
      // is not readable from the dump; two attempts to dump it hung
      // UndertaleModCli past ten minutes. LABELLED: their layer is an
      // approximation, their feedback behaviour is not.
      // The non-`draw_end` copies already drew, in the depth-sorted pass
