//
//   delay 2 (8 when obj_heroparent sets it)  nothing happens for the first
//                                            frames — the number lands AFTER
//                                            the swing connects, not with it
//   vspeed = -5 - random(2), hspeed = 10     it is thrown up and to the right
//   hspeed decays by 1 a frame toward 0      so the arc straightens out
//   vspeed += 1 while bounces < 2            gravity
//   y > ystart -> y = ystart,                TWO BOUNCES, each half the last
//                 vspeed = vstart / 2
//   killtimer > 35 -> kill += 0.08,          then it rises and fades over 13
//                     y -= 4                 frames and destroys itself
//
// THE SQUASH IS THE WHOLE LOOK. It is drawn
//
//     draw_text_transformed(x + 30, y, msg, 2 - stretch, stretch + kill, 0)
//
// with `stretch` starting at **0.2** and rising 0.4 a frame until it passes
// 1.2, where it clamps to 1. So the scale runs
//
//     (1.8, 0.2) -> (1.4, 0.6) -> (1.0, 1.0)
//
// — the number starts as a wide flat smear and snaps to square in three
// frames. Drawing it at a constant scale loses the impact entirely.
//
// And the fade reuses `kill` in BOTH the alpha and the Y SCALE: `stretch +
// kill` means the number stretches vertically as it disappears.
